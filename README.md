# Inayat-Hussain Journey from village to global Cybersecurity Expert
My name is Inayat Hussain, and I come from a small, underdeveloped city and village in Pakistan. As a child, I was always curious, passionate, and loved books. I used to ask myself questions like, "Why does this universe exist?" "What am I here for?" "What am I capable of?" Even at a young age, I had a voice inside me telling me that I was meant for something big, something global. I believed that first, I needed to conquer myself to achieve great things. I felt like I was different from everyone else, which made it hard for others to understand me. This led to a lot of isolation, not because I was an introvert, but because I balanced between being alone and social.

I would often ask myself, "Who am I?" and "What does Allah want me to do?" Growing up, I realized that if you're different, non-conformist, or think outside the box, it can be a threat to those around you who follow conventional paths. From childhood, I faced criticism and isolation for my unconventional thoughts. Despite this, I remained passionate about education, science, technology, and literature, which shaped who I am today.

My journey began eight years ago when I bought a laptop. I started exploring the world of Information Technology, cybersecurity, and computer science. At first, I spent a lot of time watching useless content and playing games, but my curiosity about science and technology kept growing. I started learning seriously, and after a year, I had developed many IT skills, including basics like programming, ethical hacking, networking, and graphic design. Over the next few years, I failed many times, especially in ethical hacking and penetration testing, but I never gave up.

I also struggled to balance my academics and considered giving up many times. But the most difficult part of my journey was the extreme isolation, criticism, and the feeling that no one understood me. I was judged by my grades, and even my own relatives didn’t see my potential. For a long time, I struggled with insomnia and anxiety, feeling lost and in pain. Everyone thought I was a failure, but I kept moving forward, even in the harshest conditions, facing storms of depression and doubt.

Alhamdulillah, after seven years, my hard work has paid off. I now have seven years of experience in cybersecurity and have earned over 60 certificates. I have also completed a diploma in Information Technology. Despite starting with very few resources, and from a place where cybersecurity was unknown, I managed to make my own path. I faced many challenges, but through Allah’s grace and my determination, I have reached where I am today.

I believe that if I can do it, anyone can. We all have the power to shape our thoughts into reality. No matter what happens in life, never give up. Believe in yourself and in Allah, keep pushing forward, and always strive to become a better version of yourself.

Shukria.
